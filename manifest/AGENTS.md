* ALWAYS keep README.md up-to-date with the manifest schema. If you make any changes to the manifest types (schema), update README.md to include the latest specification and usage, and update any examples that need to be changed.
* Make error messages and spans as helpful to devs as possible. Rust error messaging is a great example of usability
    - Create UI tests whenever adding a new error type
